This is the README file for the eyePad project. 

The first stage consists of creating an easy-to-use, user friendly eye tracked key pad for typing using The Eye Tribe(TET)
 
We'll split into 2 mini-teams, one group of 3 on the surface pro developing the UI and a group of 4 on the eye tribe.

Cross out a checkpoint when your done with it.

Checkpoint 1 Goals(for now) :
GUI Team:
A) Determine a user friendly GUI design(if you need more opinions, post a design on facebook)
	i)Decide how to position the keys
	ii)Decide what kind of motion will producea output
B) Make a rough prototype 
	i)Built a rough prototype of the GUI, i.e. a model with graphics but no           functionality(yet) 
C) 

The much-less-appreciated Backend Team:
A) Set up The Eye Tribe(TET) and get data out of it 



-------------------------------------- 
The second stage consists of incorporating Kinect's facial recognition technology and making an app where the user can create and send messages to a registered person on the system.
