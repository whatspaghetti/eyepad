----------------------------------------------------------------------
This week:

Team Eye tribe:

➢	Download SDK, it should be posted on the tutorial page.
➢	Implement 8pen using eye tribe.
➢	Determine if vertical or horizontal lines implementation would be better than the way 8 pen works. (Choose the method that tires the eye the least (fastest ?))




Team Kinect:

➢	Determine if facial recognition is feasible:
	o	If yes, start implementing it.
	o	if no, brainstorm new project ideas. 
➢	If I get Kinect V2 next week I’ll contact you. (SDK v2 works only with Kinect v2, so determine what related functions are already available in both version of the SDK)




Following week:

Team Eye tribe:

➢	Include predictive text in 8 pen
➢	Look for a software that would read the messages out loud. 
➢	Design user interface


Team Kinect:

➢	Create contact database. (It includes contact data, facial recognition data and saved messages for each contact).
➢	Determine the best way to keep track of each contact’s most used messages.
➢	Create contact sign up software.
